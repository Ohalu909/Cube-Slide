# Cube-Slide
made in Unity 

This is a 3-D game made in Unity. The game is based on a YouTube course from a guy called Brackeys. I was able to compile it and it was satisfying to complete this one. May or may not work on improving it but need to reinstall Unity first.

The game can be downloaded at the link below if anyone is interested;
